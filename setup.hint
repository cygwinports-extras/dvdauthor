ldesc: "DVDAuthor is a set of tools to help you author the file and 
directory structure of a DVD-Video disc, including programmatic commands 
for implementing interactive behaviour. It is driven by command lines 
and XML control files, though there are other programs that provide 
GUI-based front ends if you prefer."
